In this project, we developed a novel gait-based authentication model using accelerometer and gyroscope data. The core of our research hinges on the meticulous analysis of sensor data, specifically from accelerometers and gyroscopes, to capture the unique gait patterns of individuals. Our dataset, meticulously compiled and described, consists of various sensor readings that capture a wide range of human activities. These include detailed measurements across different axes (X, Y, Z) and timestamps, providing a rich foundation for modeling human motion.
The primary objective was to explore the feasibility of using gait patterns as a reliable biometric authentication method. Gait, a person's manner of walking, is inherently unique and difficult to replicate, making it a promising candidate for secure authentication systems. Our methodology involved preprocessing the sensor data to filter and normalize the inputs, extracting significant features that represent gait characteristics effectively.
We employed several machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest, to classify and authenticate individuals based on their gait patterns. Each of these algorithms brought a unique strength to the model - KNN for its simplicity and efficacy in handling multi-class cases, SVM for its robustness in high-dimensional spaces, and Random Forest for its ability to handle overfitting and provide insights into feature importance.
The results were encouraging, showcasing high accuracy and precision in authenticating individuals based on gait data. Our experiments demonstrated that gait-based authentication could effectively distinguish individuals with a high degree of accuracy, suggesting its potential as a secure and non-intrusive authentication method. The model's performance was rigorously evaluated, considering various metrics to ensure reliability and robustness.
This research contributes significantly to the field of biometric authentication, introducing an innovative approach that leverages everyday movements captured through commonly available sensors. The success of our model opens pathways for further exploration and integration of gait-based authentication in security-sensitive applications, offering a blend of convenience, security, and user privacy.
